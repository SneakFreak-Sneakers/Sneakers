        THE EARLY YEARS (1900-1949) <br>
    </b>
    </div>
   <p> Every great story has a beginning. This one started in a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After starting out in his mother’s
    wash kitchen, Adi Dassler registered the ‘Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik’ in 1924 and embarked on his mission to provide athletes
    with the best possible equipment. Gold medals in Amsterdam (1928, Lina Radke) and Berlin were first rewards and milestones – and
    only the start of our story.</p>

    <p>On August 18, 1949, Adi Dassler started over again at the age of 49, registered the ‘Adi Dassler adidas Sportschuhfabrik’ and set
        to work with 47 employees in the small town of Herzogenaurach. In the same year, he registered a shoe that included the
        registration of the soon-to-become-famous adidas 3-Stripes. From humble beginnings to a global success story – which was accelerated
        by a miracle…</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that screw-in studs on lightweight football boots would help write history? When the German national
        football team faced the unbeatable Hungarians in the 1954 World Cup final, they won so much more than just a trophy. Their
        unbelievable victory would be heard around the world for decades to come. And it made adidas and its founder a household name
        on football pitches everywhere.</p>

<p>In one of its most memorable marketing campaigns, adidas shows its biggest athletes, including David Beckham and Haile 
    Gebrselassie, facing their fears, defeats, and challenges head-on only to prove that, indeed, ‘Impossible is Nothing’. 
    The slogan became synonymous with reaching your goals.
